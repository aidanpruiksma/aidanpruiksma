### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Aidan from Virginia, and I have a deep passion for ideating and building a product that can enhance the user's experience.  My work experience has helped lay the foundation for my expertise in leadership, customer service, team collaboration, diversity awareness, and communication.  My tenure at Penn State University allowed me to apply these soft skills in addition to the techncical skills I have learned.  My anticipated graduation date is at the end of Summer 2021.
